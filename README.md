MuckPluginLoader (MPL) is a plugin loader for the game [Muck](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625450/Muck/). Users of this loader will not be able to join players whose plugins don't match the user and vice versa. This is to prevent exploitation (Not yet added).

MPL is heavily "inspired" by [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED), a plugin loader for SCP: SL that I contribute to. I say "inspired" because I think exiled is done really well so the structure is largely the same.
